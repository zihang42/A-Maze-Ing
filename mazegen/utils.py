        This class is used as a dataclass used by the Generator

        easly accessed by the shape and size property

        Attributes:
            walls: A numpy dimentional array which will be a 3D
            blocked: A numpy dimentional array which will be a 2D

            Exemple:
                For a 10x10 maze the shape method will return
                a tuple like (10, 10, 4)

            Exemple:
                For a 10x10 maze the size method return
                an int of 100 (the area of the grid)
